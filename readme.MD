This repository contains and notes and projects associated with the 2019 version of Jeremy Howard's Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3 course (https://course.fast.ai/index.html)

The directory structure will mirror for the most part the directory structure from th fast.ai v3 course. For file names, this repository contains copies of the original files from the course (fast.ai v3) course. These files are kept here with their original file names. Files that I have modified or extended will have (most) of the original file name + an additioal string to identify them. Original work will have their own file names. Unique files and projects will be described below.
